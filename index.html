            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>Flock Safety</h3>
                    <p>• Flock Safety is a Software and hardware Surveillance company which began as a startup in 2017 based out of Atlanta, Georgia. 
                    They specialize in many different technologies such as drones as first responders, 
                    Audio detection devices, and video cameras. Overall, they provide public safety technology for law enforcement, 
                    neighborhoods, and businesses. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Flock ALPR Camera </h3>
                    <p>• The technology our research analysis focuses on is Flock Safety's Automated License plate reader (ALPR) Cameras.
                        These cameras are designed to capture vehicle details from stationary, networked cameras to provide information that can be used to assist public safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • It works by taking high-resolution images of license plates and vehicle details of passing vehicles, 
                        These cameras will then upload this information to a secured cloud platform where they can be viewed analyzed.
                        Flock three main goals are to deter crime, assist law enforcement, and provide communities with data-driven insights about public safety.

        <h3>Technology Rational</h3>
            <p>•
                Our rational behind choosing this technology is because of how flock cameras are said to be providing communities and police departments with fast, data-driven method to investigating and preventing crime. 
                However, this technology has raised social and ethical questions about privacy, data use, and surveillance technology in everyday spaces.

            <h3>Priceton Manor HOA</h3>
            <p>• Princeton Manor a HOA located in Knightdale North
                Carolina installed Flock Safety cameras after a rise of
                car break in, with the hopes of capturing clear vehicle
                data than doorbell cameras and provide useful
                evidence for police. Cameras were place in all
                entrances and records who leaves and enters.
                <br>• The cameras ended up dividing the community, one
                side feeling that system was invasive while the other
                side felt supported it for security.​

        <article class = "use-case">
            <h3>Denver City Council</h3>
            <p>• Denver will stop using Flock cameras after the city
                council unanimously voted against renewing the
                contract. Despite their success in reducing car
                thefts, officials worried about data security and
                possible access by agencies that work with ICE. <br>
                
                • These worries caused many people to push back
                    over privacy concerns. Denver will finish the pilot
                    program but won’t renew the contract and will
                    create a group to review how this kind of
                    technology should be used.​
