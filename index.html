            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>Flock Safety</h3>
                    <p>• Flock Safety is a Software and hardware Surveilence company which began as a startup in 2017. 
                    They specialize in many different technologies such as drones as first responders, 
                    Audio detection devices, and video cameras. Overall, they provide public safety technology for law enforcement, 
                    neighborhoods, and businesses. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Flock ALPR Camera </h3>
                    <p>• The technology our research analysis focuses on is Flock Safety's Automated License plate reader (ALPR) Cameras.
                        These cameras are designed to capture vehicle details from stationary, networked cameras to provide information that can be used to assist public safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • It works by taking high-resolution images of license plates and vehicle details of passing vehicles, 
                        These cameras will then upload this information to a secured cloud platform where they can be viewed analyzed.
                        Flock three main goals are to deter crime, assist law enforcement, and provide communities with data-driven insights about public safety.

        <h3>Technology Rational</h3>
            <p>•
                Our rational behind choosing this technology is because of how flock cameras are said to be providing communities and police departments with fast, data-driven method to investigating and preventing crime. 
                However, this technology has raised social and ehtical queastions about privacy, data use, and surveillance technology in everyday spaces.
